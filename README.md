# Sector Investing Strategy

## Hello and Welcome to our group project! 

With thousands of stocks to invest in, it can be overwhelming for you to pick the right profitable stock. 

- Where do you start? 

- What metrics do you look at?

- What type of analysis and resources to use?

We narrow it down for you by offering a sector analysis investment strategy that present several benefits: 

- Seek Alpha

- Position for business cycles

- Understand nature of the market

We want to provide you with a stock and ETF investment strategy based on sector analysis.  Our product explains the direction of the money flow in each sector.

Sector investing is a top-down investment strategy  and a way of capitalizing on market shifts caused by changing business conditions and investor focus.

We specialize in giving buy & sell recommendations for 8 different sectors with the goal to outperform the S&P 500. In order to provide those buy & sell recommendations, we have built a machine learning model that takes in considerations several factors such as:

- Closing Price
- Correlation
- Relative Strenght Index 
- Exponential Moving Average
- 10 year treasury yield

Since we want to provide buy/sell recommendations and not the prediction of the price, we used a classification model: Support Vector Machine.
